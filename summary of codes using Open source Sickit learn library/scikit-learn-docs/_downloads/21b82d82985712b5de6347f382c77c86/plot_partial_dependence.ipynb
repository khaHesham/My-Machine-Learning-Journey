        "\n# Partial Dependence and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots\n\nPartial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function [2]_\nand a set of features of interest, marginalizing over the values of all other\nfeatures (the complement features). Due to the limits of human perception, the\nsize of the set of features of interest must be small (usually, one or two)\nthus they are usually chosen among the most important features.\n\nSimilarly, an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot [3]_\nshows the dependence between the target function and a feature of interest.\nHowever, unlike partial dependence plots, which show the average effect of the\nfeatures of interest, ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a\nfeature for each :term:`sample` separately, with one line per sample.\nOnly one feature of interest is supported for ICE plots.\n\nThis example shows how to obtain partial dependence and ICE plots from a\n:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` and a\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the\nCalifornia housing dataset. The example is taken from [1]_.\n\n.. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, \"Elements of Statistical\n       Learning Ed. 2\", Springer, 2009.\n\n..

        "### Analysis of the plots\n\nWe can clearly see on the PDPs (dashed orange line) that the median house price\nshows a linear relationship with the median income (top left) and that the\nhouse price drops when the average occupants per household increases (top\nmiddle). The top right plot shows that the house age in a district does not\nhave a strong influence on the (median) house price; so does the average\nrooms per household.\n\nThe ICE curves (light blue lines) complement the analysis: we can see that\nthere are some exceptions (which are better highlighted with the option\n`centered=True`), where the house price remains constant with respect to\nmedian income and average occupants variations.\nOn the other hand, while the house age (top right) does not have a strong\ninfluence on the median house price on average, there seems to be a number\nof exceptions where the house price increases when\nbetween the ages 15-25. Similar exceptions can be observed for the average\nnumber of rooms (bottom left). Therefore, ICE plots show some individual\neffect which are attenuated by taking the averages.\n\nIn all plots, the tick marks on the x-axis represent the deciles of the\nfeature values in the training data.\n\nWe also observe that :class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` has much\nsmoother predictions than\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that we are creating potential meaningless\nsynthetic samples if features are correlated.\n\n"
